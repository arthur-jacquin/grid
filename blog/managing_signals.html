-- <span id="001">[<a class="t" href="#001">001</a>]</span> Goals -----------------------------------------------------------------

In <a href="client_architecture">a previous post</a>, I described the different threads and how they exchange
data, but left aside how these threads can be managed by the main thread. One
particular point is the signal management, something I have never done.

So let's figure this out! Here are the questions I have:
* how to prevent threads from calling the service of a yet-uninitialized thread?
* how to clean ressources before termination, even when termination is due to
  a signal?
* how to handle signals?


-- <span id="002">[<a class="t" href="#002">002</a>]</span> Managing threads ------------------------------------------------------

Managing threads requires to store some information. For example, the thread
identifiers must be stored to later join the threads, and semaphores are used to
distribute tasks to threads. Most of this information should be hidden from
threads, to comply with the principle of least privilege and improve the
robustness of the code.

Spawned threads are only communicated their associated semaphore, so that they
can wait for tasks. Distributing a task to another thread can only be done via
the <code>post_to()</code> interface.

To ensure no thread is using uninitialized ressources from another thread, they
synchronize at the end of their initialization. <code>declare_as_initialized()</code>
declares the calling thread as initialized and ready to operate, and then blocks
until all threads are initialized (or until one fails). Notice that the function
figures out which thread is calling by itself, so that the thread doesn't manage
its own identity.

To clean ressources before termination, the <code>request_termination()</code> function is
exposed to the threads. Instead of exiting immediately, it stores the
termination request and notify the other threads, so that they can perform a
proper cleanup too.

Wrapping up all of the above give the following thread routine template:

<pre class="code">
void *
thread_start_routine(void *sem)
{
    ...                                 // initialization
    declare_as_initialized();
    if (should_terminate()) {
        goto cleanup;
    }

    while (1) {                         // main loop
        sem_wait(sem);                  // wait for tasks
        if (should_terminate()) {
            goto cleanup;
        } else if (...) {               // check for all other possible tasks
            ...                         // process the event
        }
    }

cleanup:
    ...                                 // deinitialization
    return NULL;
}
</pre>

-- <span id="003">[<a class="t" href="#003">003</a>]</span> Handling signals ------------------------------------------------------

Here are some key points to keep in mind while handling signals:

* Signals are used to notify an event to a process.

* The default behaviour of most signals can be overriden to explicitely ignore
  them or to use a custom signal handler (set with <code>sigaction()</code>). However, some
  can't be caught (e.g. SIGKILL).

* Signals can be blocked using a signal mask and <code>pthread_sigmask()</code>. Signal masks
  are per thread (while signal handlers are per process), and inherited upon
  thread creation. <code>sigwait()</code> can be used to detect and consume pending (blocked)
  signals.

* A signal is only delivered to one thread. A signal can be directed to a
  specific thread (for example, using <code>pthread_kill()</code>), in which case it is
  delivered to it. Else:
    * if all threads block it, the signal is pending
    * else, the signal is arbitrarily delivered to one of the threads that
      don't block it

* There are two types of signals: synchronous ones (resulting of a program
  action, e.g. SIGSEGV) and asynchronous ones (independent of the program, e.g.
  SIGINT or SIGKILL). A synchronous signal is always directed to the thread that
  generated it.

Asynchronous signals can occur at any time, including when a thread locked
ressources needed by a potential signal handler. If ever the signal is delivered
to that very thread, it creates a deadlock. For this reason, asynchronous signal
handling should be done in a dedicated thread.

One way to make sure all asynchronous signals are delivered to the signal
handling thread is to block them all at program startup (before any thread
creation, so that all threads inherit the signal mask), and to process them
using <code>sigwait()</code> in the signal handling routine.

Using this approach, I overriden SIGINT behaviour: grid first tries to cleanup
the ressources before exiting. The second SIGINT signal forces the termination.

For synchronous signals, both signal handlers and <code>sigwait()</code> approaches can work.
